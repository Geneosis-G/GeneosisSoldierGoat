[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]That was a quite easy mod compared to the previous two :) Mainly because the devs already made a variable to make infinite ammo on their weapons XD
Anyway I still had some work to do in order to have all the weapon effects working on any creature (not jsut on GoatZ creatures). I also had to rework part of the weapon attachment code and some stuff in the firing mechanism... But nothing too hard in the end, I could complete it in a single afternoon ^^
